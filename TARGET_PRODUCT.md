> - Best price for 100, 250, and 500 units
> - eSIM/4G integration options
> - Customization capabilities (casing, branding)
> - Sample availability and cost
> 
> We're evaluating multiple suppliers and targeting $70-90/unit range for volume orders."

**If They Quote $95+:**
> "Thank you for the quote. We're seeing similar specs at $75-85 from other suppliers. 
> Can you match that range for 250+ units? We're ready to place sample order if pricing works."

- "This is our best price" (without volume discount)
